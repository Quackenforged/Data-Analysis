# Overview

I decided to analyse a dataset of Dungeons & Dragons classes using the link below for the csv
[classes.csv](https://github.com/miethe/DnD-Character-Generator/blob/master/classes.csv)

I wrote this software to find specific data and separate out some of the different data chunks in the dataset. 
I wanted to learn how to pull certain pieces of information from a dataset to use in different types of programs and potentially games.

# Data Analysis Results

I used questions such as, How do I find how many subclasses there are of each class? and What ability saves are used by each class?
I found I could use code to answer the first but did not figure out how to answer the second. 

# Development Environment

I used pandas and anaconda to access the csv, I also used VScode to write my program and python as the coding language.
I also had to use requests from pandas to access the data.

# Future Work

* Better find ways to separate the data into smaller chunks
* Figure out how to use the data gathered to affect my program
